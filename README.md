# NXP-MIMXRT1020-EVK
intend to create in the first stage a weather or environmental station based on the iMXRT1020 able to datalog the data in a microSD memory card. In a second stage a stream data via MQTT could be setup using the ethernet periferal. If the time schedule is enough an interactive MQTT client could be setup to be feed with one or two similar modules. Using a sensor like the MPL3115 allows the device to have pressure/altitude and also temperature measurements. An environmental sensor like the Bosch BME680 could be add to have more measured variables. Both of this sensors could be connected by I2C to the 1020 board. A small LCD screen could be added to visualize the data in the weather station.
